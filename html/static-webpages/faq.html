		<b>Q: Why didn't the buyer leave feedback? </b><br/>
		A: It's a buyer's choice whether or
		not to leave feedback. However, Kukuscorner.com sends reminder e-mails to
		buyers suggesting that they provide feedback. These e-mails are
		typically sent within 2 days of the maximum estimated delivery date of
		an order or within 22 days of the order being placed (whichever comes
		first) if the buyer hasn't already left feedback. Buyers have 90 days
		to leave feedback.

		<b>Q: Can a person I refunded leave me feedback? </b><br/>
		A: Yes. We	allow customers to leave feedback after you've accepted a return
		and/or refunded them money. This allows customers who had a great
		experience with your return and refund processes to express their
		opinions. It also allows buyers who felt confused or angry by a refund
		to express their opinions.
